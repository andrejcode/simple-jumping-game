### Behind the Scenes

This game is built using HTML Canvas and JavaScript. The main elements include a simple player object represented as a rectangle that can jump, and obstacles that move from the right side of the canvas toward the player. The gameâ€™s difficulty increases as the score rises: obstacle speed gradually accelerates and new obstacles appear at random intervals.

If the player collides with an obstacle, the game pauses for 3 seconds before restarting. The ultimate goal is to reach a score of 99999, at which point the player wins the game, and further gameplay is disabled.
